# Additional Features Summary for IT Operations Capability Search

This document summarizes the additional recommendations and features for implementing a robust and extensible IT operations capability search solution using embeddings, hybrid search, and Azure AI.

---

## **1. Capability Registration System**
- Build an admin interface (e.g., web portal or CLI) for registering new capabilities.
- Store metadata in CosmosDB with fields like name, description, tags, parameters, and execution methods.
- Auto-generate embeddings for capabilities upon registration.

### Key Actions:
- Create a standardized metadata schema to ensure consistency.
- Provide real-time feedback during registration (e.g., validation of metadata and parameters).

---

## **2. Hybrid Search Implementation**
- Leverage Azure Cognitive Search to perform a hybrid search combining:
  - **Semantic Search**: Retrieve relevant capabilities using embeddings.
  - **Metadata Filtering**: Enable precise filtering based on tags, execution types, and timestamps.

### Key Actions:
- Use the `embedding` field in the Azure AI index for semantic similarity.
- Add filterable and facetable fields for better control over search results.

---

## **3. Dynamic Capability Extensions**
- Allow admins to register new categories of capabilities, such as:
  - GitHub Actions
  - Azure Resource Graph queries
  - Custom workflows or scripts
- Recompute embeddings dynamically and update the vector store.

### Key Actions:
- Design extensible metadata to accommodate diverse execution types.
- Implement a mechanism to periodically validate or update embeddings.

---

## **4. Execution Workflow Management**
- Build a system for previewing workflows before execution:
  - Display retrieved capability details.
  - Validate required parameters.
  - Offer user confirmation before invocation.

### Key Actions:
- Fetch metadata from CosmosDB for execution-specific details.
- Implement safeguards for safe and audited execution (e.g., parameter sanitization).

---

## **5. Feedback and Continuous Learning**
- Enable users to rate the relevance of search results to refine the embeddings and search logic.
- Incorporate feedback loops to improve recommendation accuracy over time.

### Key Actions:
- Add a feedback collection mechanism (e.g., thumbs up/down or rating scale).
- Use feedback to fine-tune embeddings or metadata-based scoring profiles.

---

## **6. Multimodal Query Support**
- Extend the system to support:
  - Natural language queries (e.g., "Back up my VMs")
  - Structured queries (e.g., JSON/YAML configurations)

### Key Actions:
- Train the LLM to handle diverse query formats.
- Add preprocessing logic to parse structured inputs into meaningful search queries.

---

## **7. Advanced Features**

### **Contextual Query Chaining**
- Maintain context for multi-step queries (e.g., "List runbooks" followed by "Run the backup runbook").

### **Capability Grouping**
- Group capabilities into categories (e.g., Runbooks, GitHub Actions) for better organization and discovery.

### **Versioning and Auditing**
- Support versioning of capabilities to track changes.
- Enable detailed auditing of capability usage.

---

## **8. Technical Stack Recommendations**
- **Embeddings**: Azure OpenAI or Hugging Face models for text embeddings.
- **Vector Store**: Azure Cognitive Search or Pinecone.
- **Metadata Storage**: CosmosDB with JSON documents.
- **Execution**: Azure Functions, Logic Apps, or custom APIs.
- **Orchestration**: Combine components using a RESTful API layer.
