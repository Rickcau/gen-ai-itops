# Azure Automation vs. GitHub for IT Operations

## Azure Automation

Azure Automation is best suited for:

### VM Management and Cloud Resource Orchestration

- Automating routine tasks for VMs, such as starting, stopping, and managing on a schedule[8]
- Implementing cost-saving measures by automatically shutting down unused VMs during off-hours[1]
- Orchestrating complex workflows across Azure resources[1]

### Update and Patch Management

- Managing updates across Windows and Linux machines using Azure Update Manager[1]
- Scheduling and deploying updates within defined maintenance windows[1]
- Assessing patch compliance and deploying critical updates across VM fleets[1]

### Configuration Management

- Maintaining consistent configurations across cloud and on-premises infrastructure[2]
- Automating the provisioning and configuration of Azure resources[1]

### Monitoring and Alerting

- Setting up centralized monitoring and reporting for Azure resources[1]
- Creating custom dashboards for reporting update status and VM health[1]
- Configuring alerts for critical events or compliance issues[1]

### Hybrid Cloud Management

- Managing resources in both Azure and on-premises environments[2]
- Extending automation to non-Azure cloud platforms[6]

### Compliance and Security Automation

- Automating compliance checks and audits[1]
- Enforcing security policies across Azure resources[6]

## GitHub for IT Operations

GitHub is more suitable for:

### Version Control and Collaboration

- Storing and managing infrastructure-as-code (IaC) scripts and configuration files[3]
- Tracking changes to infrastructure code over time[3]
- Facilitating collaboration on infrastructure modifications using pull requests[3]

### CI/CD Pipelines

- Setting up continuous integration and continuous delivery processes[4]
- Automating build, test, and deployment pipelines[4]

### Documentation and Knowledge Sharing

- Maintaining up-to-date documentation on IT processes and procedures using wikis[3]
- Storing runbooks and troubleshooting guides alongside relevant code[3]

### Project Management

- Using issues to track tasks, bugs, and feature requests[3]
- Organizing work with project boards[3]

### Code Review and Quality Control

- Implementing peer review processes for infrastructure changes[3]
- Enforcing coding standards and best practices[3]

### Integration with Development Workflows

- Bridging the gap between development and operations teams[4]
- Facilitating DevOps practices and culture[4]

By leveraging both Azure Automation and GitHub, IT operations teams can create a comprehensive automation strategy that covers both direct resource management and code-driven infrastructure operations.
