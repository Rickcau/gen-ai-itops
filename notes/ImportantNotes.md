# Routine IT infrastructure Tasks
- Azure Automation is typically a more straightforward and flexible choice for routuine IT infrastructure tasks such as starting or stopping Azure VMs on a schedule etc.  

# GitHub Actions
GitHub Actions ( or other CI/CD pipelines) can perform similar tasks if needed, but they're generally geared toward **software builds**, **tests**, and **deployments** rather than ongoing IT ops.

# More Detail
1. **GitHub Actions and CI/CD**

- **Primary Use Case**: Automating the software development lifecycle—building, testing, and deploying applications.
- **Possible for IT Ops?** Yes, you can write a GitHub Action workflow that runs a PowerShell or CLI script to start or stop VMs. However, you typically have to maintain your GitHub repository (even if it’s just for scripts) and manage Action runners.
- **Scheduling**: GitHub Actions supports scheduled triggers (using cron expressions in the workflow). But keep in mind you may need to ensure the runner environment is properly secured, has appropriate permissions, and the schedule meets your needs.

2. **Azure Automation Runbooks**

- **Primary Use Case**: Automating repeated IT or infra tasks such as managing Azure resources, patching servers, maintenance schedules, etc.
- **Native Azure Integration**: Runbooks (PowerShell or Python) run directly in the Azure Automation service. No external runners needed; everything is hosted and managed in Azure.
- **Scheduling**: Very easy to set up a schedule (e.g., daily 7 PM to shut down VMs).
- **Resource Context**: Runbooks can be granted exactly the permissions needed (using Managed Identities or Run As accounts).
- **Built-In Tools**: Built-in logging and job history for auditing.

3. When to Use Which

- **Use Azure Automation Runbooks** for straightforward or ongoing infra tasks (like starting/stopping VMs, cleaning up old disks, rotating logs, etc.). This is especially true if you want to leverage Azure’s built-in scheduling, job tracking, and access control.
- **Use GitHub Actions (or Other CI/CD)** if you’re already heavily using GitHub for your code, and you want your VM operations to be integrated into a more complex pipeline (e.g., spin up a VM for a test environment and shut it down after testing). Or if the action is related to a code deployment workflow.

4. **Possible Hybrid Approach**

- If you have code in GitHub, you can trigger a **GitHub Action** to call an **Azure Automation Runbook** via an API. This can be useful if you want the best of both worlds:
 - The pipeline logic and security context from GitHub Actions
 - The specialized, robust scheduling and job management from Azure Automation

# Concerns / Challenges to be aware of...
- **Managing status checks** for a triggered job/runbook is inherently more straightforward in **Azure Automation** thatn in GitHub Actions.

## 1. **Azure Automation Runbooks**
Azure Automation was built for operational tasks and includes a Job management model out of the box.

1. **Triggering the Runbook**

- You can call the **Azure Automation API** (or use SDK/PowerShell) to start a runbook job.
- This call typically returns a **Job ID** immediately.

2. **Checking Status**

- Using that **Job ID**, you can poll the **Get-AzAutomationJob** (PowerShell) or the relevant Azure REST endpoint to retrieve the job’s status (e.g., “Running,” “Completed,” “Failed,” “Suspended,” etc.).
- You could easily integrate this into your ChatBot:
   1. **User**: “Run the ‘ShutDown-VM’ runbook.”
   2. **ChatBot**: “Ok, I’ve started job ID xxx. You can check its status by saying, ‘Check job xxx.’”
   3. **User**: “Check job xxx.”
   4. **ChatBot**: “Job xxx is now Completed.”

3. **Logging & Output**

- The job history in Azure Automation captures logs. You can retrieve these logs via the same API/SDK to provide more detail on what happened.

## Why It’s Easy

- Azure Automation **natively** gives you a handle (the Job ID) that you can query for status or logs.
- Perfect for IT Ops tasks where you need a quick trigger-and-check pattern.

## GitHub Actions
While GitHub Actions can be made to do almost anything (including shutting down VMs), it’s primarily geared toward **CI/CD**. 
Checking the status of a workflow run for a ChatBot user is a bit more involved:

1. **Triggering a GitHub Action Workflow**

- Typically, you trigger an Actions workflow on **push**, **pull_request**, or **workflow_dispatch** (manual or API-based).
- If you wanted your **ChatBot** to start a **GitHub Actions workflow**, you’d have to call **GitHub’s REST API** or **GraphQL API** to dispatch the workflow.
- That means storing or passing in the appropriate repository, workflow file name, branch/ref, and input parameters.

2. **Retrieving the Workflow Run ID**

- Once you’ve triggered a workflow via the GitHub API, you can parse the response to get a **Run ID**.
- You’ll need to store that **Run ID** in your **ChatBot** context to reference later.

3. **Polling Run Status**

- You can call **Get a workflow** run to retrieve the status (**queued**, **in_progress**, **completed**, etc.).
- This is something your **ChatBot** can do **if you store the Run ID** and use it when the user asks, **“What’s the status of run #12345?”**
- Once the workflow is **completed**, you can query the “conclusion” for **success**, **failure**, **cancelled**, etc.

4. **Log Retrieval**

- You can programmatically download logs (**via the download logs API**) for the run, but you have to ***parse and format them for the ChatBot***.

## Why It’s Harder

- You’re dealing with **separate** systems (GitHub vs. Azure) rather than a single, built-in job management system.
- Permissions need to be correctly set (a GitHub personal access token or GitHub app with appropriate **repo** and **workflow** scopes).
- You must implement your own “handshaking” between the ChatBot and GitHub to correlate ChatBot requests with Action runs.

## Choosing the Best Path
- **For IT Ops** (scheduling, on-demand start/stop, patching, etc.):

   - **Azure Automation** is generally a more direct and robust choice, as it has scheduling, job logs, and status checking built in.
   - ***It aligns with Azure’s RBAC and uses a single platform for execution and monitoring***.

- **For Dev-Driven Automation** (spin up ephemeral environments for testing, deploy code, etc.):

  - **GitHub Actions** is great because it’s integrated into your GitHub repo and CI/CD flow.
  - But you still can poll the job status from your ChatBot if you implement the required APIs.

- **For a Combined Approach:**

  - You can mix both if needed—e.g., a GitHub Action that triggers an Azure Automation Runbook. Or the ChatBot triggers an Azure Automation Runbook that, in turn, calls a GitHub Action.
  - ***This complexity is rarely necessary for typical “shut down these VMs at 7 PM” scenarios***.

# Bottom Line
If **user-friendly, near-real-time** status checks are crucial for your ChatBot, **Azure Automation Runbooks** is *by far the simpler path*:

- You get an immediate Job ID,
- You can poll or subscribe to job completion events,
- You can fetch logs and display them to the user.

- GitHub Actions **can** do it, but you’ll need:

1. Additional tokens for GitHub’s API (authentication token - so you will need to generate this, i.e. you can create a personal access token)
2. Parsing the triggered workflow run to get the run ID,
3. Periodically checking the run’s status,
4. Handling logs in a custom manner.

**In most *IT operations* scenarios, Azure Automation will save you time, complexity, and make your ChatBot’s “Check job status” flow much more straightforward.**

# Conclusion
For **pure IT operations** like shutting down VMs on a schedule, **Azure Automation Runbooks** is often the most direct and cost-effective approach. 
GitHub Actions can be used if you prefer to unify everything in one pipeline or if you have workflows that spin up/shut down environments as part of
a larger CI/CD process. However, if your only goal is “Shut down these VMs at 7 PM each night and turn them back on at 7 AM,” you’ll find Azure Automation’s integrated scheduling and management features well-suited to the task.
